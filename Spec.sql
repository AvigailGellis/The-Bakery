/*
Since I was a child I've always loved baking and people have always told me that I should open a pastry buisness. 
I've just started making plans, and will be opening it in January of 2023, G-d willing. 
With all the orders that I am anticipating, I would like to have all the information stored in one place.
And of course, being that I would like to start my buisness off on the right foot, everything must be as clear and concise and possible.

I would like a table of all the orders that come in, including the customer's name, item and cost of the order. 
To give a clearer idea, I will need the item, quantity, price per unit, total sum, date ordered, and date needed by.
I would like to have the last 4 digits of their card number displayed in the chart.  
It's also important for us to track how the order came through, whether it was via text, email, mail, etc.


Questions:

Q:How much in advance can an order come in to when it needs to be ready?
A: Orders can be placed up to 60 days in advance and up to one week in advance. Orders with less than a week of notice are invalid.

Q:Can orders be placed before your grand opening?
A:Yes! We would love to have customers order from us in advance so that they can enjoy are baked goods on the first day we open!

Q:What is your price range for your goods?
A:Our items range from $2.50 - $450. Once things settle down I plan to add few grander options, with prices going as high as $650.

Q:What are the ways that customers can place an order?
A:Customers have 4 options. They can either call, text, mail, or email us.

Q:Is there any other way customers can pay?
A:They can pay with cash or card.

Q:Do you deliver?
A:Unfortunately we do not deliver, customers need to come pick up their orders.

Reports:
1. I will need a list of my top 3 goods that are the most popular.
2. I would like to know how many customers are paying with cash and how many with card, just so I can know how to better service them. (Eventually I would like to switch over to card only.)
3. I would like to have a concise list of the date, item, quantity, and order total so that I can better understand what's poplular at different times of year.
